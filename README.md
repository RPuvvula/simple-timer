# Simple-timer

Welcome to the mindful breathing timer! 
This webpage is designed to help you practice mindfulness and calmness through breathing exercises. 
The timer is set to a default interval of 5 seconds, which will reset automatically once completed. 

- To get started, simply press the 'start' button and follow the prompts for inhaling and exhaling. 
- You can also adjust the interval time or pause, reset, or sound an alert when the timer reaches zero. I hope you find this tool helpful in your mindfulness practice!
